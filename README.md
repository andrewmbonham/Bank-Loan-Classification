# Bank-Loan-Classification

## Task
The task here was to analyze bank data to determine whether or 
not customers would accept a personal loan offer from a bank.

## Description
The challenge was solved by developing a neural network classifier
that used gradient descent to optimize parameters used to predict
loan acceptance. 

## Installation
The following Python 3 packages are required:
- numpy 
- pandas
- matplotlib

To install the packages, run `pip install <package>`

## Usage
The data can be downloaded from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-ds/Visa_For_Lisa_Loan_Modelling.csv).
To execute the analysis, simply run all cells. Parameters that can 
be adjusted are the training dataset size, the learning rate, and the 
threshold for prediction in `predict(...)`.
